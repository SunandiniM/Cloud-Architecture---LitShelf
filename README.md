• Developed a cloud architecture solution for LitShelf, an online bookstore application, utilizing AWS services for load balancing, auto-scaling, and effective monitoring.
• Defined both business and technical requirements to address scalability, reliability, load balancing, performance efficiency, and cost management. Aligned the design with the 6 pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
• Created a comprehensive design draft outlining fundamental building blocks, supported by AWS Well-Architected Framework and AWS CloudFormation diagrams.
• Conducted experiments with Kubernetes and AWS to validate specific elements of the design, such as load balancing and auto-scaling.
• Configured the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to efficiently manage HTTP and SSH traffic, ensuring seamless communication between services.
• Implemented horizontal auto-scaling using EC2 instances with target tracking policies, dynamically adjusting capacity based on metrics like CPU utilization.
