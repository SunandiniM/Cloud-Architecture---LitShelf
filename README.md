# Cloud-Architecture---LitShelf
Revolutionizing LitShelf's online bookstore, I architected a robust AWS solution. Aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, it ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Experimented with Kubernetes, implemented AWS ALB for efficient traffic, and achieved dynamic auto-scaling for optimal performance.
